# Simulation Methods

This is a series of blog posts on simulation methods based on a statistics course called Advanced Simulation Methods (ASM) that I took in the University of Oxford between January and March 2014. The course was taught by [RÃ©mi Bardenet](http://rbardenet.github.io/) and [Pierre Jacob](https://sites.google.com/site/pierrejacob/). My understanding and appreciation of much of the content of the course only materialised when I wrote my dissertation supervised by [Yee Whye Teh](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/) and my research project with [Louis Aslett](http://www.louisaslett.com/).

## Plan of Attack

1. Introduction to Simulation Methods
2. Classical Simulation Methods
3. Importance Sampling
4. Markov Chains
5. Gibbs Sampler
6. Metropolis Hastings
7. Reversible Jump MCMC
8. Sequential Importance Sampling
9. Hidden Markov Models

## Why F#?

Because of [Scott Wlaschin](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/).

## Why Did I Decide To Write This?

Some courses are life-changing. This happened to be one of such courses for me. The ASM course made me work intensively on computational statistics, and looking back retrospectively, it undoubtedly set the trajectory of my career and brought me to where I am today. Aside from emotional attachments, the course was good fun and extremely enriching. Therefore, I made it a mission to share it with everyone!
