# Getting Started

The easiest way to run the code is to install Docker and simply:

1. Build the container by running `$ ./run build-docker`. This can take several minutes.
2. Invoke the REPL by running `$./run dock repl`.
3. Copy paste code onto the REPL.

If you are familiar with Clojure, you can install [lein](https://leiningen.org/) and run `$ lein repl` straightaway.
